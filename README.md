Bot: I'm sorry to hear you're feeling anxious. Remember that it's okay to feel this way. Would you like to talk about what's been troubling you?

User: I can't sleep at night
Bot: Trouble sleeping can be really frustrating. Have you tried any relaxation techniques before bed? Many people find deep breathing exercises helpful.
